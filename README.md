# BP-RBF-Prediction
Data prediction is made using BP neural networks, RBF neural networks, and RBF neural networks optimized for PSO.  
The data uses (52,4) of shape, divided into training sets and test sets, and predicts four features (controlled by num=1,2,3,4 parameters).  
Finally, the renderings of the neural network on the training and test sets, respectively, and the errors on the training and test sets are output.
